# shoeArbitrage
a web scraper that scrapes both Nike and StockX and compares shoe prices made in nodejs.
opens up all pages synchronously, working on an option where you can choose how many will open up at once for RAM limitations.

Note: the code in stockX.js doesn't work with headless so shorten nike.json accordingly
