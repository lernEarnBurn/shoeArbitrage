js (webscraping with Puppeteer)

## Accomplishments
+  Working webscraper on sites with a lot of defenses


a web scraper that scrapes both Nike and StockX and compares shoe prices and returns a json with all of the good deals.

No longer works due to changes in the websites.

P.S. works best with rotating proxies
